# Relaxer App

A relaxing breathing app with a visual director to guide your breathing exercises.

## Description

The Relaxer App is a simple web application that helps users practice deep breathing exercises for relaxation and stress relief. The app provides a visual guide in the form of a growing and shrinking circle, indicating when to breathe in, hold, and breathe out.

## Features

- Circle and gradient circle created using CSS
- Pointer (small circle) animated using CSS
- Grow and shrink animations implemented with CSS
- JavaScript used to create the breath animation effect

## Usage
